	<h2 >About Us</h2>
	<p>Kamdar.com is a web application that provides opportunities for job seekers to search for a job and for the general people to find a professional to do a job. It is a versatile platform developed to ease the task of seeking a job and hiring a professional, and the best part of it is, that there are no middle men involved.
This application is need because, at present, there is no simple method to hire professionals to do your specific/ personal task. Searching plumbers, electricians, tutors, cleaners are becoming harder daily. Lots of time is being wasted in search of those professionals.</p>
